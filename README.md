# My TechBook

A practical collection of production-ready examples, to support every solution I build.

## Overview

This repository is a living TechBook. Each example is grouped under an ecosystem and its respective pip package name, making it easy to navigate and find relevant code samples, patterns, and best practices.

## Organization

- **Top-Level Folders:** Each folder is named after a specific ecosystem e.g., Holo Ecosystem, AI Ecosystem.
- **Sub-Level Folders:** Each sub folder is named after a specific pip package.
- **Examples:** Inside each package folder, you’ll find focused, self-contained examples demonstrating real features, integrations, or techniques.
- **Loose Terminology:** Examples are flexible and may include related concepts or solutions beyond strict package boundaries.

## How to Use

1. **Choose an Ecosystem:** Start at the top-level folder that corresponds to your area of interest (e.g., Holo Ecosystem, AI Ecosystem).
2. **Find Your Package:** Browse the sub-level folders to locate the relevant pip package.
3. **Explore Examples:** Open the package folder and review available examples.
4. **Run or Adapt:** Use examples as reference, copy code as needed, or extend for your own solutions.
